😁 About me: I made the dive into the tech industry after being in education for 11+ years. I tutor new developers on the basic MERN Stack and Python while taking on freelance gigs and contributing/maintaining open source projects. I love providing visual content to the community covering what I'm currently learning and how it makes sense to ME, which could be how YOU understand it as well. I've always been a team player and will forever enjoy being a musician ([live](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Baffle+%40+2nd+Wind+12.1.17) and in the [studio](https://soundcloud.com/jonchristie)), a surfer, and of course, both a teacher and a learner.
