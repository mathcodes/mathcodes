## üíº About Me

I made the dive into the tech industry after being in education for 11+ years. I tutor new developers on the basic MERN Stack, basic Typescript, basic Python, Prompt Engineering, and Cloud Computing. As an advocate of open-source projects, I contribute to many and currently maintain the one I started, [Content For Developers](https://github.com/mathcodes/contentfordevelopers). I love providing visual content to the community covering what I'm currently learning and how it makes sense to ME, which could be how YOU understand it as well. I'm also a team player, loving helping others whenever I am able to, and really looking forward to finding a job that allows to do just that. Outside of tech, I will forever enjoy being a üé∏ musician ([live](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Baffle+%40+2nd+Wind+12.1.17) and in the [studio](https://soundcloud.com/jonchristie)), üèÑüèª surfing any chance I get, supporting üå± sustainability,  and üèÉüèº exercising.
