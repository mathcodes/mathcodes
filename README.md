## Hello and welcome! My name is Jon Christie üëã

### [MY SITE](https://www.jonchristie.net)

<br/>

I am...

<br/>

üî≠ &nbsp;&nbsp;...looking for my next `job` in `frontend web development`. I'm open to related positions including entry-level opportunities!  

üõ†&nbsp;&nbsp;...working on open-source project, `ContentForDevelopers.com` as well as optimizing scalability and performance in the MANY apps I am re-deploying having previously been on Heroku. 

<!-- üìö&nbsp;&nbsp;...currently maintaining an open source repository for $\mathfrak{\color{orange}{Hacktoberfest}}$ -->

ü§ù&nbsp;&nbsp;...interested in `collaborating` on `open-source` projects. Click [here](https://github.com/mathcodes/lc_hr_cw) if you are too!

üôãüèª&nbsp;&nbsp;...open to questions and thoughts about `coding`, `web development`, `networking`, `job opportunities` or whatever you have on your mind!!! 

üòÅ About me: I made the dive into the tech industry after being in education for 11+ years. I tutor new developers on the basic MERN Stack and Python while pickup the odd freelance gig. I love providing visual content to the community covering what I'm currently learning and how it makes sense to ME, which could be how YOU understand it as well. I've always been a team player and will forever enjoy being a musician ([live](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Baffle+%40+2nd+Wind+12.1.17) and in the [studio](https://soundcloud.com/jonchristie)), a surfer, and of course, both a teacher and a learner.
